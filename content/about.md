Hi, I’m currently pursuing a Master of Science in Data Science at Northwestern University 🎓  

My focus is on integrating data science, finance, and AI to solve complex problems and drive strategy.

Before Northwestern, I earned a Master’s in Accounting from the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota, and a Bachelor of Science in Accounting from the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. I’ve held finance leadership roles across multiple companies, including as a Finance Manager, where I built a foundation in strategic decision-making and cross-functional collaboration.

I’ve had several eye-opening experiences that led me to believe we’re living through an **exponential growth curve**. I’m not exactly sure whether we’re at the beginning, the middle, or the end — I just know that we’re close. The thing about exponential growth is that **nothing seems to happen for a while... and then everything happens all at once**.

That insight pushed me to rethink my trajectory and fully commit to the data revolution — not just watching it unfold, but actively shaping it.
