ðŸ“˜ **Description**
   
This project builds on Module 1 by showcasing a modular agent framework using OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o-mini for multi-step problem-solving. Created for MSDS 442 at Northwestern, it follows a structured reasoning loopâ€”Thought, Action, PAUSE, Observationâ€”and integrates tools like LangChain for dynamic data retrieval and calculations. The project highlights how well-structured workflows enable AI agents to reason clearly and handle complex tasks beyond simple Q&A.

### ðŸ”§ Features

- **LLM Integration:** Uses OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o-mini model, integrated into a custom agent framework for conversational interactions and problem-solving.
- **Agent Workflow:** Implements a four-step reasoning loop (Thought, Action, PAUSE, Observation), where the agent reflects, performs actions, and then outputs results based on observation.
- **Tool Use:** Dynamically retrieves or calculates information based on user input.
- **Transparent Output:** Shows the agentâ€™s logic and steps at each stage.
- **Complex Task Handling:** Solves multi-step problems through sequential reasoning.

### ðŸ’¡ Key Insight

> LLMs become significantly more powerful when paired with structured agent workflows, enabling clear, multi-step problem solvingâ€”not just single-response answers.
