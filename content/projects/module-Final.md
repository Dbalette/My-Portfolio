📘 **Description**

This final project showcases a complete product strategy simulation for a fictional consumer goods company, with a focus on data-driven decision-making, brand positioning, and market disruption. Delivered as part of the MSDS 440 Strategic Consulting course at Northwestern, the simulation involved iterative experimentation across pricing, media, and trade levers.

The final phase involved independently designing and justifying a bold, contrarian strategy that prioritized market dominance for the “Blue” detergent product. This included isolating price sensitivity curves, optimizing trade investment, and using experimental data to outmaneuver competitors who were slow to adapt.

### 🔧 Features

- **Strategic Framing:** Applied Blue Ocean strategy and price war dynamics to reshape the competitive landscape.
- **Experimentation:** Ran multiple market experiments to test elasticity, media ROI, and share of shelf impact.
- **Simulation Analysis:** Synthesized cross-period outcomes to inform a final multi-year plan grounded in data.
- **Independent Execution:** Operated independently from team consensus to craft a high-risk, high-reward strategy.
- **Deliverable Packaging:** Submitted a final roadmap, recorded presentation, and module reflections to faculty.

### 💡 Key Insight

> In highly competitive markets, playing it safe guarantees irrelevance. This project taught that bold, data-backed positioning — even at the cost of short-term margins — can enable total market disruption and long-term dominance.
