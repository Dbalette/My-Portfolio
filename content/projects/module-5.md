📘 **Description**

This project implements a financial planning agent using LangChain, LangGraph, and GPT-4o-mini. The assistant engages in natural conversations, interprets user intent, and helps with core financial tasks such as budgeting, savings goals, and net worth analysis. The system combines retrieval, prompt templating, and structured tool usage to provide intelligent, step-by-step financial guidance.

Developed as part of the MSDS 442 course at Northwestern University, this module emphasizes agentic reasoning, structured interaction flows, and transparency in automated financial decision support.
