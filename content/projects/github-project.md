ðŸ“˜ **Description**  
This project demonstrates a modular approach to building a multilingual translator using the LangChain framework and OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o-mini model. Designed for the MSDS 442 course at Northwestern University, the script highlights secure API integration, prompt engineering, and real-time language translation using large language models (LLMs).

More importantly, this project reinforces the idea that **ChatGPTâ€™s GUI is not designed to program business process workflows**. Instead, we must create explicit reasoning and action workflows â€” like flowcharts or algorithms â€” to guide AI agents. This is why we leverage frameworks such as **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, or **LlamaIndex**, which act as bridges between our agent logic and the backend LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Replicate, or Ollama).

### ðŸ”§ Features

- **Secure Environment Setup:** Uses `os` and `getpass` to securely manage API keys for OpenAI, LangChain, and Tavily, avoiding hard-coded credentials.
- **LLM Integration:** Initializes a GPT-4o-mini chat model via LangChainâ€™s `ChatOpenAI` class for efficient, conversational interactions.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Dynamically constructs system and user prompts using `PromptTemplate`, guiding the model to translate text between languages.
- **Interactive Workflow:** Accepts user-defined source/target languages and phrases, fills the prompt templates with those inputs, and invokes the model.
- **Clear Output:** Displays both the final structured prompt and the modelâ€™s translation, giving full transparency into the LLM's decision-making process.

### ðŸ’¡ Key Insight

> AI agents are most effective when treated as part of a **designed reasoning system**, not just queried through a UI. This project illustrates the importance of building clear workflows that allow agents to reason and act within structured, multi-step tasks.
