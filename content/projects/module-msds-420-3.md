ðŸ“˜ **Description**

This project explores the use of EdgeDB to model and analyze a real-world graph-relational dataset â€” Yelp businesses and reviews from the Chicago metro area. Built for the MSDS 420-3 Databases course at Northwestern University, the notebook walks through schema design, data loading, and analytical queries over a semi-structured dataset.

By adopting EdgeDB, the project illustrates how flexible, queryable schemas can unlock new dimensions of insight â€” blending the rigor of relational databases with the adaptability of graph systems. Business metadata, category tags, and review sentiment are cross-linked to enable multi-hop queries that mimic human curiosity.
