ðŸ“˜ **Description**

This project extends a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline into a stateful, conversational assistant using LangChain, LangGraph, and OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o-mini. Designed for the MSDS 442 course at Northwestern University, it builds on previous modules by introducing agent reasoning, memory persistence, and multi-step retrieval workflows.

This reinforces the principle that AI systems are most powerful when embedded into structured, state-aware workflows â€” not standalone black boxes. LangGraph offers a clean architecture to reason over conversational history, perform multi-step tool calls, and allow LLMs to act as autonomous decision-makers.

### ðŸ”§ Features

- **Memory Persistence:** Tracks multi-turn conversations using LangGraphâ€™s `MemorySaver` checkpoints.
- **Chat State as Messages:** Uses LangChainâ€™s message schema (`user`, `AI`, `tool`) for clean session tracking.
- **Agent Reasoning (ReAct):** Implements LangGraphâ€™s ReAct-style executor to dynamically decide when and how to retrieve and respond.
- **Multi-Step Retrieval:** Empowers the agent to issue follow-up queries without requiring further user input.
- **Visualization:** Supports generation of Mermaid-compatible control flow graphs to inspect reasoning structure.

### ðŸ’¡ Key Insight

> Agents are ideal for dynamic and ambiguous queries. This project illustrates how LLMs can be embedded in intelligent systems that retrieve, reason, and respond across evolving conversations â€” making them more like collaborative assistants than static tools.
