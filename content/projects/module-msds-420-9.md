ðŸ“˜ **Description**

This project explores the use of EdgeDB to create a hybrid graph-relational schema for Yelp business and review data in Chicago. The module focuses on modeling complex relationships such as user-review-business interactions, and using EdgeQL to extract insights through recursive queries and filters.

Developed for the MSDS 420 course at Northwestern, the assignment applies modern database design concepts to a real-world dataset, showcasing how graph-relational databases bridge the gap between flexibility and structure.

### ðŸ”§ Features

- **EdgeDB Modeling:** Defines object types and links to model Yelp businesses, users, reviews, and locations.
- **Recursive Relationships:** Tracks influence of reviews across users and locations using recursive EdgeQL.
- **Query Optimization:** Uses filters, sorting, and set-based logic for efficient insight extraction.
- **Graph-Relational Design:** Combines schema integrity with flexible query structures in EdgeDB.
- **Real-World Application:** Demonstrates the strengths of graph-relational modeling for complex datasets.
