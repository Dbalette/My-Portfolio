## MSDS 442-DL: AI Agent Design and Development

This applied AI course explores how to design, build, and deploy intelligent agents. Topics include:

- Reason-and-act methods  
- Finite state machines and agent architectures  
- Intelligent prompting and goal-driven systems  
- Human-in-the-loop workflows  
- API integration and tool use  
- Multi-agent systems with large language models  

The course is project-based and involves using open-source frameworks to build stateful, autonomous agents capable of completing complex, multi-step tasks.
