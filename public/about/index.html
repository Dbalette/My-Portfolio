        <p>Hi, I’m currently pursuing a Master of Science in Data Science at Northwestern University 🎓</p>
<p>My focus is on integrating data science, finance, and AI to solve complex problems and drive strategy.</p>
<p>Before Northwestern, I earned a Master’s in Accounting from the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota, and a Bachelor of Science in Accounting from the University of Nebraska–Lincoln.

<p>I’ve had several eye-opening experiences that led me to believe we’re living through an <strong>exponential growth curve</strong>. I’m not exactly sure whether we’re at the beginning, the middle, or the end — I just know that we’re close. The thing about exponential growth is that <strong>nothing seems to happen for a while&hellip; and then everything happens all at once</strong>.</p>
<p>That insight pushed me to rethink my trajectory and fully commit to the data revolution — not just watching it unfold, but actively shaping it.</p>
