    <meta name="description" content="ðŸ“˜ Description
This project builds upon the concepts introduced in Module 1 by demonstrating a modular agent-based approach to leveraging large language models (LLMs) for multi-step problem-solving tasks. Designed for the MSDS 442 course at Northwestern University, the script showcases the integration of OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o-mini model within an agent framework that follows a structured reasoning process: Thought, Action, PAUSE, Observation. The agent handles complex tasks by invoking different actions, such as retrieving data or performing calculations, while maintaining clarity through explicit reasoning workflows.
This project emphasizes the importance of creating well-structured workflows that allow AI agents to reason and act beyond simple queries, such as calculating the combined weight of multiple dogs. It highlights how tools like LangChain can be used to connect agent logic to backend LLMs, enabling the efficient execution of multi-step tasks.">

<h3 id="-features">ðŸ”§ Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>LLM Integration:</strong> Uses OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o-mini model, integrated into a custom agent framework for conversational interactions and problem-solving.</li>
<li><strong>Agent Workflow:</strong> Implements a four-step reasoning loop (Thought, Action, PAUSE, Observation), where the agent reflects, performs actions, and then outputs results based on observation.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Action Execution:</strong> Allows the agent to perform tasks such as calculating values or retrieving data (e.g., average dog weights) by dynamically selecting available actions.</li>
<li><strong>Clear Reasoning and Output:</strong> Provides transparency in the agentâ€™s reasoning process by displaying structured thoughts and actions, followed by the observed results.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-step Problem Solving:</strong> Demonstrates a complex task, like calculating the combined weight of three dogs, by using multiple steps and actions within the agent framework.</li>
</ul>
