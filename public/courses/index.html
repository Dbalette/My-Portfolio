    <meta name="description" content="ðŸ“š Courses I&rsquo;ve Taken
Hereâ€™s a selection of graduate-level courses Iâ€™ve completed as part of the Master of Science in Data Science program at Northwestern University. Each course has played a role in building my expertise in data science, AI, and analytics.

MSDS 442-DL: AI Agent Design and Development
This applied AI course explores how to design, build, and deploy intelligent agents. Topics include:

Reason-and-act methods
Finite state machines and agent architectures
Intelligent prompting and goal-driven systems
Human-in-the-loop workflows
API integration and tool use
Multi-agent systems with large language models

The course is project-based and involves using open-source frameworks to build stateful, autonomous agents capable of completing complex, multi-step tasks.">
